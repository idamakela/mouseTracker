# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

## Assignment One: App One

I made a mouse tracking web application that display different results in the UI depending on where the user clicks, the application also have a custom cursor that changes styling after every click by using useEffect, useState and a timeout function. 

This assignment was part of the Web & App development course.
